# 🛂 Age & Identity Verification System

A web-based proof-of-concept system that verifies a user’s **age and identity** using a **simulated Aadhar card** and a **live selfie**. This tool demonstrates face matching and DOB extraction to determine if the person:
- Is **18+**
- Matches the photo on the ID

> ⚠️ This is a demo application. No real government APIs or sensitive data are used.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (with Vite)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- Flask for Backend
- 📸 Webcam & File Upload APIs
- 🧠 Placeholder logic for Face Matching & OCR (mocked for POC)
- 🖼 Image preview and match scoring

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload Aadhar card (image file)
- Capture a selfie using your device camera
- Preview extracted photo and DOB
- Show confidence score of face match (simulated)
- Determine if user is **18+ or not**
- Responsive landing page with beautiful UI

## 🧠 How It Works (POC Logic)

| Step           | Description                                  |

| Aadhar Upload  | User uploads an image (simulated Aadhar)     |
| Selfie Capture | Camera opens to take a live selfie           |
| Face Match     | Simulated confidence score shown (e.g., 82%) |
| DOB Extract    | DOB hardcoded or mocked from OCR             |
| Age Check      | Calculates if user is 18+                    |
